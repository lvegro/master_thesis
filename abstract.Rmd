New technologies allow to monitor social networks through time. Like other
kinds of relational data, social networks are generally modelled through graphs.
New techniques are needed in order to analyze this kind of data, and to
visualize it efficiently. Among the various attempts made to adapt the methods of 
change-point detection to temporal network, we selected a non-parametric
graph-based test proposed by Hao Chen and Nancy Zhang in 2015. We applied this
method to a temporal network of phone calls between university students
collected during 2008-2009. A **shiny** web-app has been developed, enabling
analysis and visualization of the data in an interactive way, within a flexible
and easily extensible framework. This serves both as an exercise in
reproducible research and allows to test the robustness of the results to
changes in the data preparation and analytic choices.
